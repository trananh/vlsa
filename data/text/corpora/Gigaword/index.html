<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>English Gigaword Fifth Edition, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number 
  LDC2011T07 and isbn 1-58563-515-4, is a comprehensive archive of newswire text 
  data that has been acquired over several years by the LDC at the University 
  of Pennsylvania. The fifth edition includes all of the contents in English Gigawaord 
  Fourth Edition (<A 
href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2009T13">LDC2009T13</A>) 
  plus new data covering the 24-month period of January 2009 through December 
  2010. 
<P>The seven distinct international sources of English newswire included in this 
  edition are the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Agence France-Presse, English Service (afp_eng) 
  <LI>Associated Press Worldstream, English Service (apw_eng) 
  <LI>Central News Agency of Taiwan, English Service (cna_eng) 
  <LI>Los Angeles Times/Washington Post Newswire Service (ltw_eng) 
  <LI>Washington Post/Bloomberg Newswire Service (wpb_eng)
  <LI>New York Times Newswire Service (nyt_eng) 
  <LI>Xinhua News Agency, English Service (xin_eng) </LI>
</UL>

<P>The seven letter codes in the parentheses above include the three-character 
  source name abbreviations and the three-character langauge code (&quot;eng&quot;) 
  separated by an underscore (&quot;_&quot;) character. The three-letter language 
  code conforms to LDC's internal convention based on the <a href="http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/">ISO 
  639-3</a> standard.</P>
<H3>Data</H3>
<P>The following table sets forth the overall totals for each source. Note that 
  &quot;Total-MB&quot; refers to the quantity of date when unzipped (approximately 
  26 gigabytes), &quot;Gzip-MB&quot; refers to compressed file sizes as stored 
  on the DVD-ROMs and &quot;K-wrds&quot; refers to the number of whitespace-separated 
  tokens (of all types) after all SGML tages are eliminated: </p>

<P>The Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service ceased in 2009 and was replaced 
  in 2010 by the Washington Post Bloomberg News Service, thus accounting for the 
  quantities reported above for ltw_eng and wpb_eng. 
<P>All text data are presented in SGML form, using a simple minimal markup structure; 
  all text consists of printable ASCII and whitespace. The file "<A 
href="dtd/gigaword.dtd">gigaword.dtd</A>" in the "dtd" directory provides the 
  formal "Document Type Declaration" for parsing the SGML content. The corpus 
  has been fully validated by a standard SGML parser utility (nsgmls) using this 
  DTD file. Each data file name consists of the 7-letter prefix plus another underscore 
  character, followed by a 6-digit date representing the year and month during 
  which the file contents were generated by the respective news source, followed 
  by a ".gz" file extension indicating that the file contents have been compressed 
  using the GNU "gzip" compression utility. Each file contains all the usable 
  data received by LDC for the given month from the given news source. 
<P>Typical compressed file sizes in the current corpus range from about 3 MB (1995 
  Xinhua data) to about 30 MB (1996-7 NYT data); this equates to a range of about 
  9 to 90 MB when the data are uncompressed. In general, these files are not intended 
  for use with interactive text editors or word processing software (though many 
  such programs are likely to work reasonably well with these files). Rather the 
  files were intended to be used as input into systems for natural language processing 
  and information retrieval. 
<P>The current release uses an information structure that presents all sources 
  and content uniformly as follows: headline, dateline, and core news content 
  (usually containing paragraphs). The "dateline" is a brief string typically 
  found at the beginning of the first paragraph in each news story, giving the 
  location the report is coming from and sometimes the news service and/or date; 
  since this content is not part of the initial sentence, it is separated from 
  the first paragraph. Only three SGML entity references are used: ``&amp;amp;'', 
  which represents the literal ampersand "&amp;" character; ``&amp;lt;'', which 
  represents the "left/open angle bracket"; and ``&amp;gt;'', which represents 
  the "right/close angle bracket". All other specialized control characters have 
  been filtered out, and unusual punctuation (such as the underscore character, 
  used in NYT_ENG and APW_ENG to represent an "em-dash" character) has been left 
  as-is, or converted to simple equivalents (e.g. hyphens). 
<P> The documents are sorted into four distinct "types". The general strategy 
  for categorizing documents into these four classes was, for each source, to 
  discover the most common and frequent clues in the text stream that correlated 
  with the three "non-story" types, and to apply the appropriate label whenever 
  the DOC displayed one of these specific clues. When none of the known clues 
  was in evidence, the document was classified as a "story". The four types are: 
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>story</STRONG> : This is by far the most frequent type, and it 
  represents the most typical newswire item: a coherent report on a particular 
  topic or event, consisting of paragraphs and full sentences. As indicated 
  above, the paragraph tag "&lt;P&gt;" is found only in DOCs of this type; in 
  the other types described below, the text content is rendered with no 
  additional tags or special characters -- just lines of ASCII tokens separated 
  by whitespace. 
  <LI><STRONG>multi</STRONG> : This type of DOC contains a series of unrelated 
    "blurbs", each of which briefly describes a particular topic or event; this 
    is typically applied to DOCs that contain "summaries of today's news", "news 
    briefs in ... (some general area like finance or sports)", and so on. Each 
    paragraph-like blurb by itself is coherent, but it does not bear any necessary 
    relation of topicality or continuity relative to it neighboring sections. 
  <LI><STRONG>advis</STRONG> : (short for "advisory") These are DOCs which the 
    news service addresses to news editors -- they are not intended for publication 
    to the "end users" (the populations who read the news); as a result, DOCs 
    of this type tend to contain obscure abbreviations and phrases, which are 
    familiar to news editors, but may be meaningless to the general public. There 
    are many instances of formulaic, repetitive content in DOCs of this type (contact 
    phone numbers, etc). 
  <LI><STRONG>other</STRONG> : This represents DOCs that clearly do not fall into 
    any of the above types -- in general, items of this type are intended for 
    broad circulation (they are not advisories), they may be topically coherent 
    (unlike "multi" type DOCS), and they typically do not contain paragraphs or 
    sentences (they aren't really "stories"); these are things such as lists of 
    sports scores, stock prices, temperatures around the world, and so on. </LI>
